Actaria should allow the user to play a visual novel game that they assemble themselves using written dialogues, storylines, backgrounds, and sounds.
The coherence of the story is ensured by a system of triggers and game context.

A visual novel is defined as a story-based game represented by a directed graph.
A node of the graph is a scene — a unit of the storyline.
A scene represents a dialogue (or monologue) with a character from the story.
The dialogue offers the player multiple response choices (including the absence of a choice).
Depending on the chosen response, the current dialogue context or even the global game context may change.
Contexts are stored as sets of variables (logical variables are called triggers) and triggers themselves.

The workflow in Actaria consists of creating and editing game scenes and planning the connections between them.
In some scenes, it may be necessary to activate a trigger, while in others it may be required to switch the narrative branch to one isolated from an alternative ending.

These scenes form a directed graph of the story, which is serialized into a primitive binary format.
The binary file is passed to a virtual machine that runs the user’s game (with subsequent saving of progress).
A human-readable game format is also intended to be supported.
